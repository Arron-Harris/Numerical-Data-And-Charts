Understanding numerical data
Numerical data is data with numbers.
Examples of numerical data is height and age.
I was able to create a frequency table using the dataset made out of numbers.
First I Determined how many intervals I would need for this data set.
The numbers went from 8-282 so I thought 5 or 6 would be good.
Next I used interval width formula which is largest number - smallest number / interval number and it looked like this 282 - 8/6 = 46
Once I had this information I was able to make the frequency distrubution table.
The interval started on the first number in the dataset which is 8. From there it would move 46 numbers to the next which is 54. Then we start on 54 and move 46 numbers and go to 100. This pattern continues untill we get 6 values on the interval start side and the interval end side. I calculated the frequency by how many numbers were in between each interval. From 8-54 I look to see how many numbers are in between these two numbers. I found 4 numbers in from the data set that are in between those numbers. 4 is the frequency for the first row. I did this for all the 6 intervals. after finding the frequency I was able to calculate the relative frequency. The relative frequency is how often something happens divivded by all outcomes. I divided each frequency by the total number of data I had in the set with the 6 frequency numbers to get the realtive frequency.I used a chart to vizualize how the data looks.
